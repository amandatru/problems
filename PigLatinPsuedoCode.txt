# Pig Latin #

> Write some code that translates a string (word, sentence, or paragraph) into “pig-latin” using the following rules.

* Words that start with a consonant have their first letter moved to the end of the word and the letters “ay” added to the end.
* Words that start with a vowel have the letters “way” added to the end.
! Check if 1st letter is consonant or vowel
* Words that end in “way” are not modified.
! special cases : -way, hyphens, single letters
* Punctuation must remain in the same relative place from the end of the word.
* Hyphens are treated as two words
* Capitalization must remain in the same place.
! Formattings : - Punctuation is same, Capitalization is same
* Single letters are not modified.

Steps:
Put string in array
analyze each word

check if first letter is consonant or vowel
if consonant
  combine first letter with ay and add to end
if vowel
  add way to end

if str == way then not modified
if - then separate as two words during word analysis and put into function
if length == 1 then not modified


capitalization
  if letter in word capitalized, store index of capitals
  if punctuation exists, store index relative to end
